            <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p>In April of last year, some friends and I took a week 
                    and a half trip to Thailand.  We spent the first half 
                    of the trip in Bangkok and the second half on Koh Phi 
                    Phi Island, a small island off the western coast of 
                    Thailand.</p>
            <h1>Trouble on the first day</h1>
                <p>When we initially purchased our flights, we were not 
                    able to all get on the same flight.  So we decided 
                    that one friend and I would fly together, and the 
                    other two, a couple, would fly on a separate flight.  
                    We were all supposed to fly out the same morning, a 
                    Thursday, just an hour apart, and arrive in Bangkok 
                    late Friday night.  Unfortunately, American Airlines 
                    had other plans for my travel companion and me.</p>
                <p>Our planned take off time was 9 am.  After the plane 
                    was boarded and started taxiing from the terminal, 
                    the plane started having some type of mechanical 
                    issue and had to stay put until it was fixed.  After 
                    an hour and a half of sitting there and mechanics not 
                    able to fix the issue, the plane was taxied back to the 
                    terminal.  My friend and I were not worried as this would 
                    still put us in Dallas in time to catch our connecting 
                    flight to Seoul.  </p>
                <p>The issue was eventually fixed and the plane was taxied 
                    to the runway, and then proceed to sit for another 45 
                    minutes until it was able to take off.  This put us 3 hours 
                    behind schedule.  We landed in Dallas just 10 minutes after 
                    our connecting flight took off, but lucky for us, we were put 
                    on another flight that would take us to Tokyo and still have us 
                    in Bangkok late Friday.  Or so we thought.  We would have to haul 
                    ass to the opposite side of the Dallas airport to get new boarding 
                    passes, and got to the AA customer service desk to find out the flight 
                    to Tokyo was delayed 4 hours.  A helpful customer service agent was 
                    able to get us new flights that would take us to Frankfurt and then to 
                    Bangkok.  This would put us in Bangkok at 8 Saturday morning.</p>
            <h1>Finally in Bangkok</h1>  
                <p>After two 10 plus hour flights and a 3 hour layover in Frankfurt,
                    we finally land in Bangkok.  Getting through customs was a breeze.  
                    My friend goes to pick up his luggage at baggage claim and we run 
                    into our first issue, my friends bags didn’t make it.  Since I only 
                    had carry on, I was good.  After talking with airport customer service 
                    and leaving contact info, we were set to go meet up with our other two 
                    friends at the Airbnb.  We catch a taxi, and since he didn’t speak any 
                    English, I had to give him my phone so he could us the gps to find the 
                    place.  Since the driver couldn’t find the exact spot, we were dropped 
                    off in the general vicinity and decided we should try to find a place 
                    with wifi so we could call our friends.  We find a small coffee shop with 
                    wifi and after having a few issues getting connected, finally made contact 
                    with our friends.  It was during this time that my friend started freaking 
                    out because he realized he left his wallet with all his money and credit 
                    cards in the taxi. So after meeting up with our friends and getting settled 
                    into our Airbnb, we called the taxi company and they were able to find my 
                    friends wallet.  So all four of us grabbed a taxi and headed back to the 
                    airport.</p>
            <h1>Songkran</h1>
                <p>With all that trouble out of the way, it was time for us to start enjoying our 
                    trip.  We decided to check out one of the many floating markets in the city.  The 
                    floating market was located right next to a large canal that runs through the city.  
                    The market had vendors that were selling all kinds of food, trinkets, and souvenirs.  
                    We browsed for a couple of hours just trying out all the different snacks that were 
                    offered by the vendors.  During our first few days there, the Thais were celebrating 
                    Songkran, a Thai New Year festival that spans three days and is celebrated by having 
                    gigantic water fights all over the country.  We decided to buy tickets for a boat ride 
                    down the canal that would stop at different houses and shops where everyone in the boat 
                    would get doused with water from buckets and water guns by people along the way.  We were 
                    of course given our own buckets to use to fight back.  It was pure chaos, and we had a blast.  
                    We even got attacked by other boats that were going by.  I’m pretty sure all of us had quite 
                    a bit of dirty canal water that we swallowed and that got into our eyes.</p>
                <p>Over the next few days, we tried to enjoy as much of Bangkok as possible.  We had all kinds 
                    of exotic food, checked out one of the many temples, drinks on a high-rise rooftop bar and 
                    went to some thai kickboxing fights.  We also checked out the Songkran festivities in other 
                    areas of the city, and they were just as wild and chaotic as the first (without the dirty 
                    canal water though).</p>
            <h1>Island paradise</h1>
                <p>After spending a few days in Bangkok, we were off to Koh Phi Phi Island.  We caught a one hour 
                    flight from Bangkok to Phuket Island, took a taxi from the Phuket airport to a pier on the 
                    opposite side of the island, and took a 2 hour ferry ride to the island.  What we witnessed as 
                    we approached the island was one of the most gorgeous sites I have ever seen.  This island was 
                    absolutely beautiful.</p>
                <p>For the next few days, spent our time kayaking to different parts of the island and enjoying the 
                    different beaches.  One of note was monkey beach, where (as you guessed it) there are monkeys 
                    that live in the foliage just off the beach.  Just make sure you don’t bring any food or drinks, 
                    because they will try to take it.  I witness one monkey pull a sprite out of a shopping bag that 
                    was sitting on the beach, take it into the trees, open the bottle, and chugged it in a way that 
                    would make any frat party boy proud.</p>
                <p>Probably the most fun and most terrifying (for a 6’4” black guy who doesn’t know how to swim) was 
                    kayaking across and around the island.  I almost crapped my pants a few times as anytime a boat 
                    would go zooming by, the kayak would bob up and down and side to side with the wake.  We even came 
                    close to getting crashed into the side of a rocky shoreline on part of the island.</p>
                <p>And what island adventure is complete without raging beach parties at night.  The beaches at night 
                    were filled with tourists from around the world dancing it up to blaring music.  Among the crowds 
                    were the various fire twirlers who would put on shows for all the onlookers.</p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1> 
                <p>Our time on the island concluded and we made our way back towards Bangkok for the return flight home, 
                    retracing the same steps we took to get to the island.  Luckily for us, the flight back home was nowhere 
                    near as eventful as the flight over was as we had about 22 hours of flight time going from Bangkok to Seoul, 
                    Seoul to Dallas, and Dallas to Memphis.  All in all, this was an awesome trip with loads of awesome food, 
                    absolutely beautiful scenery, and complete trip around the world.</p>
